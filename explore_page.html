        Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there's plenty to see and do.
        You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.
        We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you'll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
        During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

        The Community Science Museum program provides free access to our unique Museums. It also supports teachers and educators by offering professional learning opportunities, resources to use in the classroom or early childhood service, and exclusive invitations to exhibition previews and special events. Our vision is to inspire students and teachers with wondrous museum learning experiences and support the education community in its work to build a thriving future.
        As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and inspire them.
        Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through for a visit.

        Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers and academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to use our resources and contribute towards them. We have online records, laboratory space, and a working relationship with a number of universities around the country.
        Research and spreading knowledge are vital parts of the Community Science Museum's work. The museum will spread research-based knowledge through methods which contribute to clarity and understanding. It is research which gives life to our collection by placing objects and knowledge in a scientific context from a cultural and historical perspective.
        The Community Science Museum supports a thriving programme of research which aims to promote new ways of understanding our collections, audiences and exhibitions. Our researchers come from a range of academic disciplines and engage with the specific practices of the museum as well as more theoretical work on the themes of historical and contemporary science, technology and medicine.
